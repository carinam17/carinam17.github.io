<p class="section-label">Background</p>

I've worked across small-group courses, independent curriculum projects, and classroom instruction with a consistent focus on structure, clarity, and learner outcomes. My experience includes:

- Designing instructional frameworks for online and hybrid mentor onboarding programs
- Writing and reviewing K–12 math assessments targeting discrete learning objectives
- Delivering SAT, ACT, MCAT, and TSI preparation courses for The Princeton Review
- Building original curricula and problem sets for K–12 and undergraduate mathematics

I hold a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and bring additional depth in data analysis — Python, SQL, and data visualization — which informs how I think about learner progress and content performance.
