## Overview

I work at the intersection of **instructional design, mathematics education, and educational technology**. My experience spans curriculum development, live instruction, and data-informed decision making. This includes contract roles, independent projects, and classroom-based teaching, with a focus on clarity, structure, and learner outcomes.
