## Overview

I work at the intersection of **instructional design, mathematics education, and educational technology**, with experience spanning curriculum development, live instruction, and data-informed decision making. My work includes contract roles, independent projects, and classroom-based teaching, with a focus on clarity, structure, and learner outcomes.

## How This Experience Comes Together

Across roles, my work is unified by a consistent approach:
- **Structure before complexity**  
- **Conceptual clarity paired with practice**  
- **Respect for adult learners’ time, goals, and prior knowledge**

This perspective informs how I design courses, teach learners, and build educational products.
