### What I Do

I’m Carina Mata, a mathematics educator and instructional designer specializing in adult and college-level learning.

My work focuses on clear explanations, conceptual understanding, and structured practice. I’ve taught and developed curriculum across tutoring, group instruction, test preparation, and self-guided learning environments.

I design instructional content through Convergent Math and collaborate on education and training projects that support learners building quantitative and technical skills.

### Contact Me


As much as I enjoy teaching, I know that learning is just as important. With all the diversity of people and ideas, collaboration is critical to any meaningful advancement in knowledge, skill, and experience.   

If you think I may be able to help you in some way, let me know. I especially welcome the input of students and fellow educators in improving and developing my own work.
