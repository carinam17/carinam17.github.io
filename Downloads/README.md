Here are resources for various topics in mathematics, IT, and writing. I hope they are helpful in your studies. Reach out to me if you have questions, comments, or suggestions about these materials. And check back in for more materials as I upload them.  


### Mathematics
I have tutored and taught mathematics for years. Here are some exercises and strategies that I have recommended to students to help them progress at a faster pace as well as achieve better outcomes in their courses. The full set of resources will be released as Turnkey Mathematics in fall of 2019. 


#### Factoring Numbers Practice

The ability to factor quickly and accurately can help immensely. It will help you simplify and add fractions, factor polynomials, and work with ratios among other mathematical tasks. Use these [**exercises**]({{ carinam17.github.io }}/Downloads/Factoring_Practice.pdf) to factor numbers quickly. Print them out or simply write them on a sheet of paper to build this key skill.

#### Verb Lists

A common strategy in language learning is to start with the most commonly used words in that language. This makes sense given that you are more likely to encounter those words when speaking and reading. The following are sets of common verbs.
