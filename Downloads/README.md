## Mathematics
I have tutored and taught mathematics for years. Here are some exercises, guides, notes, and strategies I have recommended to students to help them progress at a faster pace as well as achieve better outcomes in their courses. The full set of resources will be released as Turnkey Mathematics in fall of 2019. 


### Factoring Numbers Practice

The ability to factor quickly and accurately can help immensely. It will help you simplify and add fractions, factor polynomials, and work with ratios among other mathematical tasks.   

Use these [**exercises**]({{ carinam17.github.io }}/Downloads/Factoring_Practice.pdf) to factor numbers quickly. Print them out or simply write them on a sheet of paper to build this key skill. You may also use a whiteboard to erase and start over again.

## Spanish

Spanish is a lovely language with a rich literary tradition. I am grateful to have access to the language through my parents. Below are some resources I've made to help an intermediate Spanish student. 


### Present Indicative Guide 

The present indicative is the first tense learned by students of Spanish. Use this guide to understand how to form and use the present indicative: [**Part 1**]({{ carinam17.github.io }}/Downloads/Present Indicative Guide Part 1.pdf)


###  Flash Card Sets

Flash cards can be used to retain vocabulary. The following sets are useful for Spanish learners. As an important note, it is necessary to be able to translate words from English to Spanish even though that is more challenging.   

Secondly, consider writing sentences with the words or saying them aloud in order to retain them more easily.

### Verb Lists

A strategy in language learning is to start with the most commonly used words in that language. This makes sense given that you are more likely to encounter those words when speaking and reading. The following are sets of common verbs.

 ### Overview of Websites
 
 Here is a quick [**introduction**]({{ carinam17.github.io }}/Downloads/Website_Overview.pdf) to considerations for website design. Creating a website doesn't need to be a hassle., 

## Information Technology

Here are some resources to help certification exams like the Network+ and Security+.

### Flash Card Sets

IT Certification exams require the test taker to be able to accurately recall facts and defintions. Flash cards are helpful in this case, however I suggest creating a memory game. Flip all the cards over and turn them over. If you don't find a matching pair, return the card and select again.   

Since you have to commit the terms to memory during the game, you will further strengthen your ability to recall them later.
