Here are resources for various topics in mathematics, IT, and writing. I hope they are helpful in your studies. Reach out to me if you have questions, comments, or suggestions about these materials. 


### Mathematics
I have tutored and taught mathematics for years. Here are some exercises and strategies that I have recommended to students to help them progress at a faster pace as well as achieve better outcomes in their courses. 

#### Factoring Numbers Practice

The ability to factor quickly and accurately can help immensely. It will help you simplify and add fractions, factor polynomials, and work with ratios among other mathematical tasks. Use these [exercises]({{ carinam17.github.io }}/Downloads/Factoring_Practice.pdf) to factor numbers quickly. Print them out or simply write them on a sheet of paper. Time yourself and see if you can improve how quickly you can complete a [set.]({{ carinam17.github.io }}/Downloads/Factoring_Practice.pdf) . 


### Spanish

Spanish is a lovely language with a rich literary tradition. I am grateful to have access to the language. Below are some resources I've made to help a intermediate Spanish student. 


#### Present Indicative Guide 

The present indicative is the first tense learned by students of Spanish. Use this three part guide to understand how to form and use the present indicative: [Part 1]({{ carinam17.github.io }}/Downloads/Present Indicative Guide Part 1.pdf)

#### Flash Card Sets

Flash cards can be used effectively to retain vocabulary. The following sets are useful for Spanish learners.

[Days of the Week]({{ carinam17.github.io }}/Downloads/Days_of_the_Week_Flashcards.pdf)

[Colors]({{ carinam17.github.io }}/Downloads/Colors.pdf)

#### Verb Lists

A common strategy in language learning is to start with the most commonly used words in that language. This makes sense given that you are more likely to encounter those words when speaking and reading. The following are sets of common verbs.

### Content Writing
