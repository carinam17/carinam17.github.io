## Content Writing 


Writing can be a thorn in the side of many businesses.
The right words speak volumes and capture the essence of your brand. Less than optimal words are at best a missed opportunity and at worst can detract from a brand or business. 


Across all platforms, precise messaging draws a customer and makes the case for your business, products, or services. I provide the following content types to suit your needs. 

 
*** 
### Website copy

Businesses and service providers don't necessarily need a website; they need more customers and clients. The good news is that a strategically designed website can meet this goal--an important component of which is clear and compelling content.  Written content (known as copy) includes biographies, company profiles, and product or service descriptions. 


### Product names, slogans, and taglines

What's in a name? Quite a bit, since it is often the first impression clients and customers will have about your company, products, or services. 

Clarity combined with stylistically interesting and vivid descriptions position your product and service as exactly what your customers and clients want or need, so make sure every word counts.

### Blog posts

Blog posts are opportunities to educate potential customers as well as position yourself as an authority in your field or your company as a dependable leader in your field. Sharing this content on social media further engages your audience and draw prospects to your business. 

These pieces should be interesting and appealing to a human reader, yet optimized to be suggested by search engines. Since blog writing takes valuable time, consider delegating this important task to a writer.

### Product and service descriptions

Let a descriptive and precise product description show clients and customers exactly what advantage you offer and remove any doubt that you or your business are the best in your class. This content is especially critical for landing pages and online stores because prospective customers make decisions very soon after engaging with your digital content. 


### Line Editing and Revision

A second pair of eyes never hurts. Even better, the input of an experienced writer can enhance the impact of your written content. From catching elusive grammatical errors to improving structure and format, line editing and revision services are a great option for businesses looking to refine and polish their messaging.

> "I had the pleasure to meet Carina at Geekdom, where she was an active member and helped organize the writer's group. She took the leadership for this group and kept us in check and organized, so we could progress on our writing skills.

>Also, on a personal level, she was an important member on the launch of our first comic book Super Chikis. She helped us with the copy editing as English is not my first language. In this project, Carina was very professional, always providing valuable input and correcting errors a previous copy editor had not picked up.
