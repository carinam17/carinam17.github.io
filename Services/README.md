> "I had the pleasure to meet Carina at Geekdom, where she was an active member and helped organize the writer's group. She took the leadership for this group and kept us in check and organized, so we could progress on our writing skills.

Also, on a personal level, she was an important member on the launch of our first comic book Super chikis. She helped us with the copy editing as English is not my first language. In this project, Carina was very professional, always providing valuable input, and correcting errors a previous copyeditor had not picked up.

In general, Carina is a very motivated and detail oriented team mate, where she will be a valuable asset in any team she joins." -Luz Andrea Diaz
