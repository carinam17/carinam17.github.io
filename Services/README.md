## Content Writing 


Writing can be a thorn in the side of many businesses.
The right words speak volumes and capture the essence of your brand. Less than optimal words are at best a missed opportunity and at worst can detract from a brand or business. 


Across all platforms, precise messaging draws a customer and makes the case for your business, products, or services. I provide the following content types to suit your needs. 

 

#### Website copy

Businesses and service providers don't necessarily need a website; they need more customers and clients. The good news is that a strategically designed website can facilitate this goal--an important component of which is clear and compelling content. This written content (known as copy) can include biographies, company profiles, product and service descriptions. 


#### Product names, slogans, and taglines

What's in a name? Quite a bit, since it is often the first impression clients and customers will have about your product or service. 

Clarity combined with stylistically interesting and vivid descriptions will position your product and service as exactly what your customers and clients want or need. 



#### Blog posts


Blog posts are opportunities to educate potential customers as well as position yourself as an authority in your field and your company as a dependable leader in your field. Share this content on social media to further engage your audience and draw prospects to your business. 

These pieces should be interesting and engaging to a human reader yet optimized to be suggested by search engines. Blog writing takes valuable time, so considering delegating that task to a writer if you need blogs as marketing material. 

#### Product and service descriptions

Let a descriptive and precise product description show clients and customers exactly what advantage you offer and remove any doubt that you or your business are the best in your class. This content is especially critical for landing pages and online stores.


#### Line Editing and Revision

A second pair of eyes never hurts. Even better, the input of an experienced writer can enhance the impact of your written content. From catching elusive grammatical errors to improving structure and format, line editing and revision services are a great option for businesses looking to refine and polish their messaging.

#### Service: Line editing and revision


> "I had the pleasure to meet Carina at Geekdom, where she was an active member and helped organize the writer's group. She took the leadership for this group and kept us in check and organized, so we could progress on our writing skills.

>Also, on a personal level, she was an important member on the launch of our first comic book Super Chikis. She helped us with the copy editing as English is not my first language. In this project, Carina was very professional, always providing valuable input and correcting errors a previous copy editor had not picked up. -Luz Andrea Diaz


<!--- In general, Carina is a very motivated and detail oriented team mate, where she will be a valuable asset in any team she joins." --->

<!--- ## Private Tutoring
Learning is such a personalized experience that many find themselves in need of one-on-one support. I have been a trusted guide through the mathematical studies of students from a broad range of backgrounds. I provide high quality, personalized mathematics instruction to fit the needs of students of all kinds.
Education opens doors, so work with me to achieve better outcomes in your math courses. I offer several options for maximum flexibility. --->

<!---### In-Person Tutoring
Learn alongside a skilled tutor. Sessions can be held at several locations depending on availability. This includes your school, a library, a coffee shop, or a downtown office space.
### Online Tutoring
Receive your lesson from any location. I use video chat and an online whiteboard to provide the same high quality instruction I do in person.
