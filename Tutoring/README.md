### Math lessons made for you

Learning is such a personalized experience that many find themselves in need of one-on-one support. I have been a trusted guide through the mathematical studies of students from a broad range of backgrounds. I provide high quality, personalized mathematics instruction to fit the needs of students of all kinds.

Education opens doors, so work with me to achieve better outcomes in your math courses. I offer several options for maximum flexibility.

### In-Person Tutoring


Learn alongside a skilled tutor. Sessions can be held at several locations depending on availability. This includes your school, a library, a coffee shop, or a downtown office space.


### Online Tutoring

Receive your lesson from any location. I use video chat and an online whiteboard to provide the same high quality instruction I do in person. 


### Group Sessions 

Chances are that you're not the only person having difficulty in your math course. Get together with a group of classmates for a review session before an exam. Collaborate and support each other while paying less per person. These are also conducted online using video chat.


### Custom Study Materials 


Want someone to consolidate what you need to know for a test or course in one well designed document? You might also benefit from supplementary exercises to practice for a quiz or test. Reach out to get study resources tailored to your exact needs for more efficient studying.

#### Service: Tutoring in mathematics

> "Carina Mata helped me earn an "A" in my Introduction to Mathematics class at UT!  As someone who has never been good at math, I was amazed at my progress. Carina was able to explain concepts in a way that finally made sense.  I was no longer afraid of math and I looked forward to our tutoring sessions. Carina really helped me to gain confidence in my ability to learn just about anything!"

#### Service: Tutoring in General Physics, General Chemistry, and Calculus I and II


> "Carina Mata is an enthusiastic and hardworking teacher. She not only created interesting applications for Physics and Chemistry problems, but she also patiently guided me through any frustrations I faced while enrolled in those courses. I truly appreciated her efforts to familiarize herself with my learning style and to tailor her lesson plans to fit my preferred methodology. She was even able to engage me in material I would not have otherwise explored."

## Course Instruction and Curriculum Development

I have taught and developed courses in standardized test preparation, algebra, probability and statistics, and discrete mathematics. Here are some of my notable outcomes. 


#### Service: Test prep instruction for the CARS section of the MCAT 

> The critical thinking and reasoning section of the MCAT is regarded as the most difficult section. I received the highest rating possible in all my student evaluations. 


#### Service: Curriculum design for a programming and mathematics course


> I created and piloted a course to teach statistics to middle and high schools using the programming language R. This earned a $200,000 grant for further development and was well-received by students.
