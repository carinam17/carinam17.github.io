title: A brief overview of mathematics courses
---


<!--- Here is a listing of mathematics courses you may encounter throughout your education. --->


### Elementary Mathematics
This encompasses all the math learned prior to pre-algebra and includes concepts like mathematical operations, fractions, decimals, and proportions. A solid foundation in these topics will ensure success at higher levels of mathematics.

### Algebra Sequence

Algebra is a departure from earlier mathematics. Abstract concepts are introduced and a student will need to demonstrate a wide variety of problem solving techniques. After Pre-Algebra are Algebra I and Algebra II. Students are generally expected to have completed an algebra sequence prior to enrolling in college level mathematics courses.

### Geometry
Geometry is the study of lines, surfaces and solids and characteristics like length, angles, area, and volume. It is a very visual subject and requires algebraic techniques as well as some proof writing. Generally, geometry is taken between Algebra I and Algebra II.

### Trigonometry

Trigonometry (Greek for triangle measure) is the study of triangles. Specifically, it looks at the relationship between the angles and side lengths of triangles. The course involves computation as well as proof writing and is most often included in Algebra II and Pre-calculus.

### Calculus Sequence
Calculus is the study of change. After Pre-calculus, the sequence is generally divided into three courses: differential, integral, and multivariable. Calculus requires familiarity with algebraic concepts as well as geometry and trigonometry.

Expect to take calculus courses if you are majoring in the following subjects:

- Physical Sciences
- Engineering
- Computer Science
- Pre-Med

### Discrete Math

Schools may offer a course that is a survey of topics in discrete mathematics in addition to specific courses for each field. Below are some of the fields included in discrete mathematics.

**Logic:** This provides the language and framework of mathematical reasoning.The concepts are also important in programming.

**Set Theory:** The study of objects known as sets. Many fields of math include principles of set theory.

**Combinatorics:** This is the study of how structures can be combined and arranged.

**Probability:** This subject concerns measuring the likelihood that an event will occur.

**Number Theory:** This field explores properties of numbers in general. Principles from this field provided the basis for cryptography and computer science.

### Proof based Courses
This broad category includes courses that test a studentâ€™s ability to reason and apply principles of logic. Mathematics major are expected to take several proof writing based courses like set theory, abstract algebra, and analysis. Additionally, computer science students should understand these concepts as they apply to programming.


### Differential Equations
A course on ordinary differential equations is generally required for mathematics, physics, and engineering majors. Expect to use knowledge of calculus for this course. You may also take partial differential equations.

### Statistics
Statistics is the study of how to measure and characterize data. Its principles can be widely applied to fields such as psychology, marketing, and actuarial sciences.

## Which courses should I take?
It is recommended that you work with your academic counselor to design a course plan that fits the requirements of your degree plan or course of study.

These courses are sequenced and the details of your degree plan or course of study should be reviewed when registering for classes.
