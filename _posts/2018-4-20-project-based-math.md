title: Application Based Mathematics
published: false
---

If you ask students about their experience learning math, it's not uncommon to hear that it was difficult, boring, not relevant, and inaccessible. 

Contributing to this is the manner in which mathematics is taught to K-12 students. The end goal of current instruction is to enable students to pass the multiple-choice standardized tests that are either state mandated or necessary for college admissions. 

Emphasizing the procedural actions needed to answer multiple choice questions does little to encourage inquiry and develop problem solving skills. A project based approach instead allows students to learn and apply mathematics through the use of programming languages. They will build and test tools to solve problems. 


### A new approach 

Application Based Mathematics is my attempt to bring education into the present. It introduces the following changes to traditional K-12 instruction in mathematics:


#### Includes team projects

Collaboration is needed throughout life. Team projects let students brainstorm and share ideas. They will later delegate tasks, complete objectives together, and reflect on the experience.

#### Engages students who like interactive activities

The natural setting for mathematics is alongside its applications. Students will understand mathematics in its appropriate context and explore problem solving by creating and using tools to solve mathematical problems. 


<!--- Instead of telling students about bar graphs and histograms, let them create and use them in an activity.

<!--- Students will create and use a tool to solve mathematical problems. 

#### Equips students with in-demand skills

As workforce needs change, so too do the type of skills needed to gain access to well paying career options like software engineering, networking, and data analysis. Ensure students are ready to thrive in a changing world. 


#### Prepares students for a changing world

Not all students know which careers are available to them, especially if they are first-generation to attend college. By learning relevant applicants of math like computer science, they will gain insight and access to the skills and knowledge needed for success in technological fields. 


#### Demonstrate the utitility of mathematics

Mathematics are used the following fields: social sciences, psychology, data analysis, engineering, science, and many more. Schools should allow for interdisciplinary approaches to education and broaden the reach of lessons to students.

### Format 
The projects are delivered to a class of 4-12 students and 
#### Form teams
The teams will be 
#### Receive an introduction 
#### Learn syntax of the 
A module is one section
It can be adjusted to fit schedules and used where grade level appropriate.

##### Applied Statistics with R
Statistics appears on tests like the SAT and ACT as well as AP exams. Furthermore, it is used across various disciplines like social sciences, psychology, and marketing. --->


<!--- ##### Mean, median, mode, range, and standard deviation --->


<!--- #### How can someone get involved? 
Consider completing this survey []. It is anonymous, does not collect personally identifiable data, and will help understand attitudes towards mathematics and the learning experiences.
