title: What makes an effective tutor?
---

In order to effectively teach a concept, a tutor has to do much more than simply repeat the information in a manner that makes sense to them. Instead, they need to adapt their communication in order to target the learning style of their student. Here are some actions and qualities of an effective tutor:

### Determines where a student stands before a session
Prior to the session, the tutor should have established a way to determine a student's level of understanding. This can include a short skills test or survey. Lesson plans are then arranged according to the student's current needs.

### Sets goals and creates plans to meet them
A tutor should help the student set both short term and long term goals and provide guidance in reaching them. For example, this may include improving quiz grades or completing homework more easily. The plan to reach the goal can include doing extra practice problems or reviewing the material after a class. 

### Understands the complexities of the subject
A skilled tutor not only thoroughly understands the concepts but can also recognize where the difficulties will occur in the learning process, allowing them to address any misunderstandings as they arise.

### Provides engaging instruction
You've probably had a professor or instructor who walks into class, talks at the class, and then walks out. It is much more engaging to involve the student in the discussion by encouraging questions and checking comprehension along the way.

### Teaches in your preferred learning style
Every mind is different, so a good tutor shouldn't expect to teach the same way every time. Using visual aids or different communication styles, a tutor will adapt to the needs of the student.

### Reinforcing Skills and Concepts
In order to sharpen any skill set, you need to practice in an effective way. A good tutor provides example problems and exercises to test understanding. These should be illustrative and at the appropriate skill level.

### Demonstrates a patient attitude
An effective tutor is invested in your success and combines strong content knowledge with a patient and encouraging approach. Math can seem daunting at times, so it's important to approach math with a positive attitude.


Remember that the benefit of private instruction is the ability to receive targeted support and personalized instruction. Skilled tutors will embrace the individual needs of a student and meet them exactly where they are in their educational journey.
