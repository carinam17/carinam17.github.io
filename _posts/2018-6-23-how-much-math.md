title: How much math do I need to take?
---

Since math is so widely applicable, most programs of study will require the successful completion of a certain number of courses. In general, an understanding of algebra is expected at an undergraduate level. Many schools use standardized tests for placement, so expect to have to demonstrate a certain proficiency with high school level math before being able to take college level math courses. 

Schools may also offer and recommend remedial courses to reinforce the course content. Some schools accept credits earned in high school or by examination and will allow students to take higher level math courses sooner. Here is a breakdown of how much math you may need for a specific major:


### Liberal arts
For non-science and non-math majors, schools will set a terminal course or require a minimum number of hours in math courses. Fields like psychology may require statistics.

### Physical Sciences
Expect to take all or part of a calculus sequence for chemistry, physics, astronomy, and biology. You may also need to take differential equations and linear algebra for physics.

### Engineering
Engineering students need a full calculus sequence and may also require differential equations and linear algebra.

### Computer Science
Computer Science majors will need to take at least some calculus in addition to logic based courses like discrete math. The specific requirements for this program do often vary.

### Business and Economics
Business majors may need to take a specific calculus course designed for business. A course such as statistics may also be a degree requirement.

### Pre-Med Track
To apply to medical schools, you will need to have completed calculus courses. Check the requirements of your prospective schools.


## College Readiness

Taking steps to ensure college readiness in mathematics will help save money on classes and set you up for better outcomes overall. Consider taking some time to refresh your knowledge of math concepts before starting classes again, especially if it's been a while since you've seen the material. 


Keep in mind that these are very broad categories, but in my experience, they are a good guideline for what to expect in your particular field of study. As always, consulting your program requirements and school advisors is highly recommended.
