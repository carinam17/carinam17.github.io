Maybe you're in the process of deciding to begin taking classes at a two or four year college. Or maybe you've already registered and are awaiting your first day of class.



It's natural for this task to seem daunting and stressful at times, especially if it's been a while since you've had to sit through a lecture, do homework, and take quizzes or tests. 


Here is some advice and recommendations I know have helped students reach their educational goals in a more effective manner. They're written with mathematics courses in mind but are relevant to other subjects as well.

### Don't cram for tests 


You might be able to scrape by with a passing grade, but you are not setting yourself up for long-term success. 


In particular, math courses are *cumulative*, so you can expect to see concepts you've already learned and are assumed to have mastered. Stronger retention actually comes for regular practice instead of all night cram sessions. 


Instead, set a manageable study schedule and stick to it. You will be reduce stress and prepare more efficiently. As a bonus, you'll get more sleep. 



### Attend office hours 



Your professors, course assistants, and class tutors are there to help you succeed in your classes. Of course, you have to take the initiative, but use them as a resource.  


At the beginning of a course, take note of office hours and contact methods. Establish communication early on and take advantage of opportunities for extra help and clarifying questions. 



### Do your homework (seriously)

Optional is not optional if you want to succeed in the class. Often times, professors will not count homework toward your overall grade. Instead, the assignments are intended to serve as practice and reinforcement of the concepts taught. 


Despite this, do the homework and use it as an indication of how well you understand the material. Troubleshoot and get extra help if needed to perform better on graded assessments. 



### Develop good study habits


Making dedicated time for studying and stick to it. Shorter, consistent study sessions are better than longer, sporadic ones, so schedule regular time to do so. 


Furthermore, control your environment to make studying easier. This might include going to a library or student center. If you take care of children, you may even want to have a trusted person watch over them for a few hours. 



###  Use your goals as a motivator

Higher education is one of many routes to improve ones prospects and can open the door for careers, offer knowledge and skills, and provide personal fulfillment. Whatever the reason, your decision is commendable. 

Don't forget your reasons for attending school and know that you're capable of reaching your goals. 



### Remember that everyone's educational path is different



Don't compare yourself to others or feel that you are somehow less capable than your classmates. 

I have worked with or know students who began their college coursework with remedial mathematics and went on to become engineers, programmers, and many other professions.
