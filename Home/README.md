**Instructional Designer**

**Education | Mathematics**

I design clear learning experiences for complex ideas, with a focus on adult education, mathematics, and learning platforms. My work centers on making systems, concepts, and workflows understandable and usable for learners.

This site serves as a professional profile and portfolio for education and edtech roles.
